## Questions

1. What is the purpose of an IP address?

    To identify a specific device in a network, which other devices can learn, and to optimize the movement of information/ 

2. What is a DNS? What are the benefits of using domain names instead of IP addresses?

    A DNS is a Domain Name Service that maps a name to an IP address. This is helpful because these names can be more straightforward and intuitive.  

3. What is the difference between a static IP and a dynamic IP?

    Static IP has a constant address, no matter the network. Dynamic IP has an address assigned by the network and can change. 

4. What is the tradeoff between UDP and TCP protocols?

    TCP is more reliable communcation, but UDP is faster. 

5. Why can't we use the delay function with Blynk?

    Blynk is "event based" so an individual delay function would throw off the timing, and prevent synchronization. 

6. What does it mean for a function to be "Blocking"?

    No other programs can run while that function is being executed. 

7. Why are interrupts useful for writing Non-Blocking code?

    To give the system a trigger for when something should be done, especially as the system is asynchronous

8. What is the difference between interface and implementation? Why is it important?

   Interface is how the function is called, and implementation is how the function is executed. It is important because the programmer needs to make sure the interface and implementation can interact properly.
